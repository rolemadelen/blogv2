Getting Things Done (GTD) is a task management system created by productivity consultant, David Allen. GTD helps you organize and prioritize your tasks. It achieves this by systematically categorizing each task using your preferred note-taking method, which can be either analogue or digital.

GTD consists of five steps:
1. Capture
2. Clarify
3. Organize
4. Engage
5. Review

In the _Capture_ stage, you simply jot down everything that comes to your mind: ideas, thoughts, or even plans. The purpose is to externalize your thoughts by writing them down, making them visually accessible. Next, you'll move to the _Clarify_ stage, where you assess each task. Can you do it right now? Should you delegate it to someone else? Does it have a specific deadline?

Once you have clarified your tasks, you will move on to the _Organize_ stage. For tasks that require multiple actions, place them in a project folder. For reference materials like files or images, put them in a reference folder. If a task has a due date, mark it in your calendar.

Now, it's time to _Engage_. You no longer have to ask yourself, "What should I do now?" because every task that was previously jumbled up in your mind is now clearly written in your GTD notes with priorities. You will know what to do and won't forget any tasks.

Remember to _Review_ your notes at the end of each week. Add tasks, update existing ones, or remove tasks that are no longer relevant or within your control.
