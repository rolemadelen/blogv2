There are two types of Shinobue: _Uta_ and _Ohayashi_.

The Uta type shinobue has different fingering holes and is tuned in the western style. On the other hand, the Ohayashi type has all the same fingering hole sizes and is not tuned in the western style. Ohayashi is the original shinobue, specifically crafted to be played during Japanese festivals or with Lion dances.

The Japanese festival is called matsuri bayashi, but it is also referred to as ohayashi, which is the same as the shinobue type.
