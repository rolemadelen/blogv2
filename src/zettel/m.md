I lived in this location for approximately 2 years during my time in Japan.

The availability of a Mt. Fuji view depends on the building and the location of your room, but it is a fantastic feature. Additionally, you can enjoy the beauty of sakura directly from your balcony.

The bus stop is conveniently located right in front of the apartment, just a 2-minute walk away. From there, it takes approximately 25 minutes to reach Hiratsuka station. Furthermore, there is a convenience store just around the corner, and if you need groceries, the gyomu-market is also nearby. Consider getting a bike, as it would take around 10~25 minutes to walk to these places.
