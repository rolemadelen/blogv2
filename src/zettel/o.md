Shinobue is a traditional Japanese bamboo flute made from a type of bamboo called shinodake. The term 'shino' (篠) is derived from 'shinodake,' and 'bue' or 'hue' (笛) means 'flute' in Japanese.

Shinobue is commonly played during Japanese festivals (matsuri bayashi) or in taiko music performances to enhance the liveliness by adding colorful sounds with the shinobue.
