Seemingly unrelated ideas or thoughts can become relevant when viewed from different perspectives.

독 (poison) and 벽력탄 (explosive shells) may initially appear unrelated to each other; however, they share commonalities in terms of being used for mass destruction and requiring significant financial resources for production. Therefore, by tracing the flow of large sums of money, investigators could potentially identify the entities responsible for either 독 or 벽력탄.
