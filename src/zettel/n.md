I came across some advertisements on Twitter about these flashlights and initially thought they were fake. However, it turns out they are actually incredibly bright ðŸ˜‚

To activate the main lamp lights, you can simply short press the power button. There are three options: Turbo, Medium, and Strobe. Additionally, you can adjust the head of the flashlight to change the radius of the light.

By long pressing the power button, you can activate the side lamp light, which offers four different modes.
