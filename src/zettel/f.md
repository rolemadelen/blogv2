Let's say you wrote a blog post and your view count says one-hundred. You may think that only a hundred people have seen your post but that might not be the case.

The concept of an _invisible audience_ suggests that your words, content, ideas, or influence have been heard, seen, or affected by people exponentially more than you might realize.
