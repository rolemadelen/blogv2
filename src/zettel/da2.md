At any time of the day, you may come up with an idea or thoughts that you want to revisit later. You can jot these down in your "fleeting" or "capturing" notes before they escape your mind.

For example, while reading a blog post, a particular sentence might give you an insight or spark some thoughts. You can quickly write down these thoughts in your fleeting note, whether it's a post-it, notepad, your phone, or any other convenient medium. Later in the day, you can review these notes and decide whether you want to delve deeper into the topics or discard them.
