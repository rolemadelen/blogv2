Literature notes consist of your interpretations of what the author is attempting to convey.

When you read a book or an article, you will encounter an essential message related to the topic the author is addressing. Merely copying their words or paraphrasing them will not help you remember the information because it lacks your personal engagement. Instead, you should strive to comprehend the author's main point and articulate it in your own words when taking literature notes.

If you can't explain it in your own words, it means you didn't fully understand it.
