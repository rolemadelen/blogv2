People often compare themselves to the most successful person they know in their social circle or even to individuals they don't know at all. These comparisons can be dangerous because they lead us to have an inaccurate perception of our actual position.

For example, if you have just started running, it can be motivating to compare yourself to a group of people at a similar level, working together to improve. However, comparing yourself to a gold medalist is unlikely to be helpful, is it?
