It's been about 3 months, or almost 4 months, since I came back from Japan. 
I'm finally reunited with my partner and our little puppy, a German Shepherd. Everything has been great. I was confident that with my experience, I would get a job and start working as a front-end engineer again by June.

Today is June 24th, and I haven't even had a chance to do an interview, 
except for one, which I managed to get into the final 4th interview but didn't get the 
offer â€” and this wasn't even a developer job, by the way.

Well, life never goes as you planned.
