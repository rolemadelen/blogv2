## Life

Until the beginning of this year, I was working as a frontend engineer
at a startup in Japan. As I had planned to move back to the States by the end of February,
I had to resign from my job. Right up until my last day at work, I was dedicated
to developing a brand new website, and I successfully launched it before leaving.
_I'd like to express my gratitude for all the gifts and letters I received. Thank you!_

In early March, I arrived in Kentucky.
It's unbelievable that we now have our very own house.
There's still a lot to do, like painting, fixing broken faucets,
patching up cracked walls (caulk?), and more. However,
I'm really happy to finally have a place where I can unwind and relax.
Oh, and our neighbors are awesome too. And have I mentioned the view?
The lush greens are simply perfect.

## Jobs

I had been actively searching for remote job opportunities and was quite confident
that I would secure a position by the end of June. I started applying for
frontend engineer roles around mid-April, but by the end of June, I had only managed
to secure a single interview, and to my disappointment, it wasn't even for a
frontend position. In fact, when considering only the frontend positions,
I had zero interviews. I was genuinely shocked and disheartened that I couldn't
even make it to the initial interview stage.
I can't find a better word than "현타" to describe how I felt.

My confidence took a severe hit, and I was unsure about what steps to take next.
I felt guilty towards my partner since she was the sole breadwinner at the moment.
Every morning, she would head off to work while I remained at home,
staring at my computer screen. Although I had saved some money from my time working in Japan,
it still weighed on me. Thankfully, with the support of my amazing partner,
I was able to regain my self-esteem and restore my confidence to where it should be.

Recognizing that my resume, experiences, and projects were rather average,
I realized that I was just one among many candidates out there.
Therefore, [I made the decision to create a portfolio](./i-decided-to-make-a-portfolio) and update my [CV](<(https://www.jiieu.com/#/cv)>).
While I'm unsure if these actions will lead to any changes, I believe that good things will eventually come my way.

## Projects

I made some updates to my blog design. Previously, it had the following appearance.

However, it has now transformed into the blog you're currently viewing.
I decided to eliminate the HOME section, where visitors could choose between
the `about` and `blog` sections. Additionally, I removed the header because
I found all of these elements to be cluttered.

I also worked on a card game called "神経衰弱" or "Concentration."
It's also commonly known as "Pairs" or "Matching."
My partner has been wanting to play a card game,
so I created this game specifically to play with her.
For development, I utilized React, Tailwind CSS, and incorporated the Pokemon TCG API
to include actual Pokémon cards.

## Coming up

### Data Structure Study

I've started a data structure study with my friend.
We've planned to cover several essential data structures,
including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs.
Our main emphasis will be on grasping the concepts and understanding these data structures deeply,
rather than solely focusing on coding. To enhance our understanding,
we've decided to explore them using different programming languages.
Personally, I've chosen TypeScript as my language of choice for this study.

### Algorithm Study

I've been actively involved in an algorithm study group with six participants,
including myself. For solving the problems, I have been using Rust,
which has been a great language for algorithmic problem-solving.
Up until now, the problems we've tackled have been relatively straightforward.

However, I've realized that I haven't dedicated much time to studying Rust recently.
Therefore, I need to allocate a specific time slot to focus on strengthening my Rust skills.
It's important to ensure that I give Rust the attention it deserves,
as it will ultimately enhance my proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving.

### Svelte Study

React has been my go-to framework for frontend development, but I'm eager to expand
my skill set and explore other technologies. As a result, I have recently embarked
on learning Svelte. I plan to invest more time in studying and
familiarizing myself with Svelte, and I intend to utilize it in my side projects
as a means of practice.

Currently, I am working on a website called 'Things I Want.' This website serves
as a platform for showcasing my curated collection of desired items.
It's essentially a personal space where I can gather and share the things
that pique my interest and capture my aspirations. By using Svelte for this project,
I aim to gain hands-on experience with the framework while creating something meaningful
and personally fulfilling.

## Reflection

Why is it already July?!

Time has flown by like... no, it feels like it just teleported from January to July (\*sigh\*).
The best thing that could happen before the end of 2023 would be for me
to secure a job. Nevertheless, I'm determined to focus on enhancing my frontend skills,
diving deeper into algorithms, and strengthening my understanding of data structures.

To wrap up this lengthy post, I'd like to share the music that has been on constant replay
for me in the past month: ['Peter Pan' by G-Idle](https://open.spotify.com/track/4QbdGSGyECE7IRtjolOkjO?si=5b86ff6f328a44b1).
