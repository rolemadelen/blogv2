Throughout my childhood, I was a bashful kid who did everything to avoid attention, 
except when it came to running. Despite being the quietest student in school, 
I gained a reputation as the fastest kid around. In fact, running was what got me out of 
bullying in the first place.

In high school, I seized the opportunity to join the Track & Field team. 
As I progressed to become a varsity 100-meter sprinter, the once timid and reserved child transformed. 
Running became a catalyst for personal growth, boosting my confidence, enhancing my self-esteem, and teaching me valuable lessons in teamwork and assertiveness.

I vividly recall the very first time I participated in the 4x100 _(four by one)_ race as a varsity runner.
Positioned as the second-leg runner, I calmly awaited the baton exchange.
Our team was trailing behind, with our runner a couple of steps behind the other four runners.
As soon as the baton was handed to me, I unleashed my sprint, swiftly catching up to all four 
runners ahead. With precise timing, I handed the baton to our third runner, and I watched 
our anchor leg sprint towards the finish line securing the first place. Our coach later 
informed us that it was the first time our varsity team won 4x100 â€” _Coach Robles, I hope you're all well._

I no longer engage in running since I have discovered a new spark of joy in my life. Nevertheless, I truly loved running.
