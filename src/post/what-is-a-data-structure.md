A data structure is a well-organized collection of data, intended to be accessed and modified efficiently through dedicated operations.
Data structures can be categorized into two main types: _Linear Data Structures_ and _Non-Linear Data Structures_.

### Linear Data Structure

A linear data structure is defined by elements arranged sequentially, one after another.
Examples of linear data structures include: _Arrays_, _Linked Lists_, _Stacks_, and _Queues_.

Linear data structures exhibit the following characteristics:

- Data elements are organized sequentially in a contiguous manner.
- The elements exist on a single level.
- A complete visitation and traversal of all elements can be achieved in a single pass.
- Memory usage may not be optimal as a block of memory needs to be pre-allocated.

### Non-Linear Data Structure

A non-linear data structure does not adhere to a specific sequence for storing its elements. Instead, it organizes them in a hierarchical manner where each element is connected to one or more other elements.
Examples of non-linear data structures include: _Trees_ and _Graphs_.

Non-linear data structures exhibit the following characteristics:

- Data elements are not arranged in a sequential order.
- The elements are organized hierarchically, with multiple layers.
- Visiting all elements typically requires multiple passes through the structure.
- Memory utilization efficiency varies across different non-linear structures.
