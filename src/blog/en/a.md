A data structure is an organized collection of data that is designed to be accessed and modified efficiently through specific operations.

## Types of Data Structure

Data structures can be classified into two main categories: _Linear Data Structures_ and _Non-Linear Data Structures_.

### Linear Data Structure

A linear data structure is characterized by elements that are arranged sequentially, one after the other.

Examples of linear data structures are:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

Linear data structures possess the following characteristics:

- Data elements are organized sequentially in a contiguous manner.
- The elements exist on a single level.
- A complete visitation and traversal of all elements can be accomplished in a single pass.
- Memory usage may not be optimal since a block of memory must be pre-allocated.

### Non-Linear Data Structure

A non-linear data structure doesn't follow a particular sequence to store its elements. Instead, it arranges them in a hierarchical manner where each element is linked to one or more other elements.

Examples of non-linear data structures are:

- Trees
- Graphs

Non-linear data structures possess the following characteristics:

- Data elements are not arranged in a sequential order.
- The elements are present in a hierarchical manner, with different layers.
- It is not possible to visit all elements in a single pass. Multiple passes are required to go through all the layers.
- The utilization of memory varies across different structures in terms of efficiency.
